# Attendance-System-using-Facial-Recognition
This project implements an attendance system using facial recognition. A deep learning model is built from scratch to identify faces in a video stream from a webcam. The model is trained on a dataset of images of people to be recognized and validated on a separate dataset. The attendance of recognized people is recorded in an Excel worksheet.
